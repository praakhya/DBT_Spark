# DBT_Spark
Our project topic is “Twitter Streaming using Spark and Kafka”. As part of our project we explored some basic features of spark and kafka via libraries available in python. We used some text/csv files containing assorted twitter feeds from the year 2020 as our input. Then we utilise a combination of Kafka and Spark to read and organise that data.
